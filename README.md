Final project for CS165
Your final project is to write a C program that reads from standard input and lower cases all the read characters. Your C program must consist of at least two source files.

You must also create a make file for this project. The make file should rebuild the C program anytime it gets out of date.

You should use this program in a Bash script that is invoked as shown below

lc file1 file2

where file1 is the name of a file to lower case and file2 is the name of the resulting lower cased file. If lc is not invoked this way, then the lc script should print a usage statement to the screen along with documentation on how to use lc.

Your lc script and your C program should all be in the same directory.
